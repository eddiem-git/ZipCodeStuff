#INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

***_WHATS A STACK_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
Last in is the First Out (LIFO) data structure.

Supports two basic operations called push and pop.
  1. Push operation adds an element at the top of the stack.
  2. Pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack. 
```

***_What is a LinkedList_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Linear data structures where the elements are not stored in 
contiguous locations and every element is a separate 
object with a data part and address part.
 
* The elements are linked using pointers and addresses.
Each element is known as a node. 
 
* LinkedList class implements the list interface.
```

***_What is a Collection_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* An interface which ensures a class has the ability to hold a series
 of objects
```

***_What is a List_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Java List is an ordered collection. 
* Java List is an interface that extends Collection interface. 

* Java List provides control over the position where you can insert 
 an element. Accessing elements by their index and 
 also search elements in the list.
```

***_What is a  Arraylist_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Dynamic in capacity (size)
* Size increases upon insertion, decreases upon removal.
* Can only handle non-primitive types.
```

***_Why throw exceptions_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. 

* It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an 
exception so it is better for the programmer to provide the 
exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.
```
***_Whats the difference between check exception and unchecked exception
_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
* Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.
```


***_Whats the difference between throws and throw_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
THROWS goes on the method signature
```

***_What are Zipfiles?_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Simply a collection of one or more files and/or folders but is 
compressed into a single file for easy transportation and compression. 

* The most common use for ZIP files is for software downloads.
```
***_What is polymorphism?_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

* We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method 
overriding. 
```
***_What is Spring?_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* Spring is an enterprise Java framework.
* Spring makes use of Inversion of Control(IOC) and Dependency Injection
 to promote good software coding practices and speed up 
 development time.
```
***_What is SpringBoot?_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
* SpringBoot is an open source Java-based framework used to 
create a micro Service.

* Spring Boot reduces the need to write a lot of configuration and 
boilerplate code.

* Spring Boot is an opinionated instance of a Spring application.
```

***_Difference of abstract and interface_***. ðŸ‘‡

```
MAIN DIFFERENCE : 

* Abstract class can have instance methods that implements a 
default behavior.
* Methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot 
have implementations.
```

***_What is JDBC?_***  ðŸ‘‡

```
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard 
Java API for database-independent connectivity between the 
Java programming language and a wide range of databases.
```
***_Solid principles of software engineering_*** ðŸ‘‡

```
Dependency Inversion principle 
Interface segregation principle
Liskov Substitution principle
Open / Closed principle
Single Responsiblity principle 
```
***_3 WEB TIER ARCHTECTIURCAL_*** ðŸ‘‡

```
BROWSER , NETWORK, Web Server, Network, database
the Network is Sequel between WebServer and database.
Jason and html is between webserver and browser
```
```
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
```

***_How does a hashmap work_***

```
1. HashMap works on the principle of hashing, we have the 
put() and get() method for storing and retrieving 
object from HashMap.

2. HashMap uses linked list in case of collision an object 
will be stored in next node of linked list. Also, 
HashMap stores both key and value tuple in every node of 
linked list in the form of Map.
```
***_Tuple_***

```
A tuple is just a sequence of objects that do not necessarily 
relate to each other in any way
```
***_Dependency Injection_***

```
1. Dependency injection is a pattern to allow your application 
to inject objects on the fly to classes that need them, 
without forcing those classes to be responsible for those objects.
 
2. It helps our code look clean and more readable.
